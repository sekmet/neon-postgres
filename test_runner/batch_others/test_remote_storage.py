#
# Tests that a piece of data is backed up and restored correctly:
#
# 1. Initial pageserver
#   * starts a pageserver with remote storage, stores specific data in its tables
#   * triggers a checkpoint (which produces a local data scheduled for backup), gets the corresponding timeline id
#   * polls the timeline status to ensure it's copied remotely
#   * inserts more data in the pageserver and repeats the process, to check multiple checkpoints case
#   * stops the pageserver, clears all local directories
#
# 2. Second pageserver
#   * starts another pageserver, connected to the same remote storage
#   * timeline_attach is called for the same timeline id
#   * timeline status is polled until it's downloaded
#   * queries the specific data, ensuring that it matches the one stored before
#
# The tests are done for all types of remote storage pageserver supports.
